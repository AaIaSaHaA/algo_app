Algo is an educational game specifically created for Artificial Intelligence students, aiming to facilitate the learning of various Machine Learning algorithms. The name "Algo" is derived from "Algorithms" and the game functions similarly to Akinator, a popular character-guessing game. However, in Algo, the objective is to guess the specific Machine Learning algorithm that the user is thinking of. By engaging in this interactive game, students can enhance their understanding of different algorithms while having an enjoyable learning experience.
